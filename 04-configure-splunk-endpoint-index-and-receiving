## 🧠 Objective

Log in to the Splunk Web UI, create an `endpoint` index, and configure Splunk to listen on port **9997** to receive data from your Universal Forwarders.

## 🔧 1. Log in to Splunk Web

1. Open a web browser and navigate to your Splunk server’s web interface:

   ```text
   http://192.168.10.10:8000
   ```
2. Enter the **Admin username and password** you set when first starting Splunk (during `./splunk start --accept-license`).
3. Click **Sign In**.

## 📂 2. Create the `endpoint` Index

1. In the top-right corner, click **Settings** (gear icon).
2. Under **Data**, click **Indexes**.
3. Click **New Index**.
4. Configure the new index:

   * **Index Name**: `endpoint`
   * **App Context**: `search`
   * Leave other settings at their defaults (you can adjust retention and size limits later).
5. Click **Save**.

## 🌐 3. Configure Receiving Port (9997)

1. In the Splunk Web UI, click **Settings** in the top-right.
2. Under **Forwarding and receiving**, click **Receive data**.
3. Click **New** under **TCP**.
4. In the dialog that appears, enter:

   * **Port**: `9997`
   * **Source type**: leave as **automatic** (or specify if you prefer)
   * **Index**: select `endpoint`
5. Click **Save** to enable Splunk to listen on port 9997.

## 🔄 4. Verify the Receiver

1. From the Splunk Web home screen, open the **Search & Reporting** app.

2. Run the following search to confirm the TCP input is active:

   ```spl
   | rest /services/receivers/tcp-servers/local-inputs | search disabled=false | table port, index, sourcetype
   ```

3. Confirm you see an entry for port **9997** with `index = endpoint`.

4. From the Splunk Web home screen, click the **Search & Reporting** app.

5. Run the search to ensure the TCP input is listening:

   ```spl
   | rest /services/data/inputs/tcp | search name="9997" | table name, disabled, index
   ```

6. Confirm you see an entry for port **9997**, `disabled = false`, and `index = endpoint`.

---

## ✅ Outcome

* Splunk Enterprise is now listening on port **9997** for Universal Forwarder traffic.
* A dedicated index named **endpoint** is ready to store incoming Windows and Sysmon events.
