# Cybersecurity-SOC-Lab
 SOC lab project with AD and Splunk on Ubuntu

# EJON SOC Lab ‚Äì Active Directory + Splunk Integration

## üß† Overview

This project simulates a real-world **Security Operations Center (SOC)** by creating an Active Directory (AD) environment and integrating it with **Splunk** on a **Ubuntu Server**. It demonstrates log collection, monitoring, and basic alerting from domain-joined Windows machines.
