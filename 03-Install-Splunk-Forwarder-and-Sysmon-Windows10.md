1. Download Sysmon from Microsoft Sysinternals:
   `https://docs.microsoft.com/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon`
2. Extract `Sysmon64.exe` to `C:\Tools\Sysmon\`.
3. Place Olaf‚Äôs Sysmon configuration file (`olaf-sysmon-config.xml`) into the same folder.
4. In an elevated PowerShell prompt, install Sysmon with Olaf‚Äôs config:

   ```powershell
   cd C:\Tools\Sysmon

## üìù 3. Create `inputs.conf` for Splunk Forwarder

1. Open File Explorer as Administrator and navigate to:

   ```text
   C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\system\local
   ```
2. Create a new file named `inputs.conf` and paste the following content:

   ```ini
   [WinEventLog://Application]
   index = endpoint
   disabled = false

   [WinEventLog://Security]
   index = endpoint
   disabled = false

   [WinEventLog://System]
   index = endpoint
   disabled = false

   [WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational]
   index = endpoint
   disabled = false
   renderXml = true
   source = XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
   ```
3. Save and close the file.

## üîÑ 4. Restart Splunk Forwarder Service

In an elevated PowerShell window:

```powershell
Restart-Service splunkforwarder
```

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome

* Splunk UF and Sysmon are installed with Olaf‚Äôs configuration.
* The Forwarder is now shipping Application, Security, System, and Sysmon operational logs into the `endpoint` index on your Splunk server.

---

## üîú Next Steps

* In Splunk Enterprise, verify data ingestion:

  ```spl
  index=endpoint sourcetype="XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" | head 10
  ```
* Build dashboards and alerts based on the `endpoint` index events.
